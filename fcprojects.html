        <h3 class="projects">Generator</h3>
        <p class="description">For the past few days, at the time of this writing, I have been focusing a lot of time on a generator program. My main focus of this program is to strengthen my knowledge of the Python language.</p>
        <h4 class="reasons">Focus:</h4>
        <p class="reason">The main focus of the program is to further expand my knowlege and understanding of Python.<br>It is a very vast language that is used for a variety of purposes. I also love coding as it allows me to practice and learn new ways of coding.</p>
        <h4 class="reasons">Plan:</h4>
        <p class="reason">My plan for the project is to allow users to generate usernames, emails or passwords to create any type of account they want. If I get the chance, I plan to sell it.</p>
