        <p class="certs">For the past few months, I have been working hard on getting my Security+ Certification. It is a course that talks about malware, hacking, encyption, file integrity, and more. It is essential for becoming a certified <strong>Cybersecurity</strong> expert. They only release these every three years to keep up with constant attacks. This allows us professionals to get on-board with what is happening in the cyber field.</p>
